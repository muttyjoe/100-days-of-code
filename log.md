### Day 4: Thursday 4th March 2021 - 70 mins

**Today's Progress**: Got up to: Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element in Applied Visual Design.

Also spent time reading about CSS Variables online to try to understand in more detail as I've seen these appear a lot recently in sites I've been looking at.

**Thoughts** Liverpool sucked today.

Took extensive notes on the freecodecamp Applied Visual Design section.

**Thoughts** Need to go back over animations and take netter notes. It's nearly 4am and I'm so tired which definitely affected my note taking.

### Day 14: Sunday 14th March 2021 - 60 mins

**Today's Progress**: More learning of CSS Grid - I love it! Finished Ben Frain Chapter 5. Continued with 1st project on FreeCodeCamp and used Variables.
